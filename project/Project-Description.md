# Title

Autonomous Exploration and Coverage Using LIDAR and Deep Reinforcement Learning

# Project Description

1) 2D Unicycle Model Simulation: Develop a 2D simulation of a LIDAR-equipped unicycle robot for area coverage.
2) RL Algorithm Implementation (2D Unicycle): Implement and compare at least two RL algorithms for the 2D unicycle model.
3) Dynamic Environment Simulation: Introduce moving obstacles. Update RL algorithms to handle dynamic environment.
4) Model Extension (2D Bicycle): Extend the 2D simulation and RL algorithms to bicycle model.
