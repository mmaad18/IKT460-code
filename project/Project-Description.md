# Project Description

I think I've decided on what I want to do.

I want to make an area coverage robot which only uses LIDAR to navigate. 
I want to start out by doing a simulation of the robot in a 2D environment, and then a 3D environment.
First I want the robot to have a unicycle model, and then a bicycle model.

I'm not sure which RL algorithms I should use.
I'm not sure which environment I should use.

### Title Proposals:

Do you have any better suggestions for the title?
- LIDAR-based Area Coverage Robot
- Area Coverage Robot using LIDAR and Reinforcement Learning
- Nonholonomic Area Coverage Robot using LIDAR and Reinforcement Learning
